        - All LCP outputs now include cost, time_converted, length_m, length_km fields
        - All polygon outputs now include area_m2, area_km2, area_ha fields
        - Fixed barrier support: proper sf to Spatial conversion for all algorithms
        - Layer organization: automatic grouping and styling of output layers
